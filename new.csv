The principle of MPPT is to extract the maximum possible power from a solar panel by setting the most efficient combination of voltage and current - maximum power point.</p> <img width=54 src="/assests/images/why%20you-no_loveme.png" heigh=65 /><p>The BlueSolar supports Advanced Maximum Power Point Detection. Unlike the conventional MPPTs which tend to lock to a local MPP when shady conditions occur, [which may not be the optimum MPP], Advance Maximum Power Point Detection will harvest maximum energy by locking to the optimum MPP.
